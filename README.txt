Topics I Find Interesting:
1. The history of how computers came to be, and the pioneers responsible.
2. Programming in general; specifically, how lines of text/code interface with the physical systems to perform actions.
3. The physical setup and working of computers; beyond just building your own PC, how it turns electrical signals (1s and 0s) into usable output.
4. The different ways computers can be used: simple calculators, quantum computing, video games, AI, etc.
5. How dependent as a society we are on computers, the internet, and technology in general.

Topics I May Find Challenging:
1. Coding syntax; how the code interacts with itself to perform functions.
2. Keeping the many different programming languages organized in my head (tangentially related: https://xkcd.com/927).
3. Using the right tool for the job; when to use specific coding languages, and when not to.
4. Organizing my code efficiently.
5. Managing my time properly so I can devote enough time to my coding work.
